# A sombre tale of tinnitus and hyperacusis
pubdate: 2023-08-24 22:54 CEST

I've been playing guitar since I was 12, and got an electric guitar when I was 15. When I was about 17 years old, I tried to play black metal with some friends, ignorantly on very high volume with no ear protection.

Later in life I would go to concerts, but if I forgot to bring earbuds, I would mostly just shrug it off. The ringing in my ears, as with most people, disappears after a day or so anyways.

Until it didn't.

Tinnitus is the sort of thing that sneaks up on you. You go to a concert and have a strong ringing in your ears. It gradually fades - maybe you go to bed and wake up with a hangover, so it's still there, but goes away as you get better.

Until one day, it doesn't *quite* go away. It's almost unnoticable, and very mild, so it might even take days for you to notice it's even there, especially if you live in the city with a lot of ambient traffic noise or the countryside surrounded by water or trees blowing in the wind.

But okay, you notice and you've learnt your lesson. It's pretty mild and is entirely unnoticeable when you are sitting on the street, or listening to music or a podcast, or with the sound of leaves blowing in the wind or waves crashing against the shore. It's okay.

Tinnitus has a nasty habit of getting slowly (almost unnoticeably) worse over the years. You may have very good ear protection but it's only going to protect you so much, especially if you're at the front of the crowd close to the speakers, or if you take them out every now and then to re-adjust them because they're uncomfortable.

Tinnitus is also one of those conditions that's poorly understood on a physiological level, and relates to some of the most sensitive and vulnerable parts of our bodies: The brain and the eardrum. It's hard (impossible?) to tell whether they stem from damaged eardrums or damaged neurons - and in either case, there's nothing that can be done to heal them.

The best treatment you can get for tinnitus is psychotherapy - specifically cognitive behavioral therapy - to convince your brain that it's not such a big deal, and to focus on other things.

There's a great movie called [Sound of Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_Metal) (which I'd totally recommend to any audience) about a person going deaf and dealing with that. At one point a deaf mentor of his tells him that deaf people have to be reminded daily that deafness is not something to be fixed. The implication being that soccumbing to this mindset will lead you down a road of non-acceptance, enviousness and what-if thinking, which will just lead to more misery. This hardly only applies to going deaf - plastic surgery to "cure" body dysmorphia is another example of where this could go wrong.

Sheer acceptance is a better option, but it's a daily struggle, and a lot of work.

Recently, my tinnitus took a new turn. After a particularily bad hangover, I couldn't help but notice something had changed for the worse. Not only was the ringing in my ears constant, but a lot of sounds were now downright uncomfortable and ugly. The sounds of cars or bikes on the street, before just a mild annoyance which would only get frustrating if exposed to it for hours, would downright make my ears hurt. The ringing has become so constant and incessant that it leads to very mild tension headaches almost every day. It's hard to compare this to anything else - the best I could think of was, imagine being just slightly seasick all the time. You're constantly barely nauseous, and movements that would otherwise be fine tend to make you nauseous.

I learnt a new term kind of randomly: Hyperacusis - hypersensitivity to sound. It's very common to happen in combination with (or as a worsening of) tinnitus and is obviously what I have a mild version of.

### Meaning of life and how it changes

While the physical illness of tinnitus and hyperacusis can kind of be reasoned with, and even dealt with in a similar fashion to how you'd deal with something like a disability like an amputated arm or allergy, for me it triggers some much deeper problems.

I consider myself a very rational person. Many factors led to this: Growing up in a Norwegian family where emotions generally weren't talked about a lot, computers being my main hobby well into my teenages, primary and secondary school bullying...
So if I struggle with depressive thoughts, there's usually some kind of rational line of thinking that brings me out of it: I can provide value and build something useful in this world, and even if not, there is still hedonistic fun to be had.

When your very existence suddenly becomes one of constant discomfort, your main source of joy suddenly gives you a mild headache, and any relief is merely a temporary distraction - your perspective changes.

Suddenly, I'm rationally thinking, how much discomfort am I actually willing to endure?
At what point does constant pain or discomfort get in the way of enjoying life in and of itself, especially if those discomforts directly relate to some of the things you enjoy the most in life?

Depression and suicidal thoughts often do not come from wanting to die, but rather not being able to endure living any more.
As a rational person, I'm suddenly confronted with a deeply disturbing conundrum: I either re-program my brain to not care so much about the things I used to care a lot about, or surrender to a deep sadness.


[A study that's stuck with me](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20350058/) shows that we view our future selves with the same regard as a total stranger on the street. In that context, it makes sense that it's difficult (or at least requires a lot of discipline) to go on a diet, go to the gym, or reduce our overall consumption of fun in the present to have a more pleasureable future.

This, of course, assumes that you actually do want to prioritize your future. The economy has been going through crash after crash since 2007, social media seems to favor a lot of harmful tendencies of humanity, climate change just keeps getting worse and there's systematic inability to deal with it, bigotry and misinformation is on the rise... All of my friends have expressed a deep concern about the idea of bringing children into the world as it is today, and I'm personally not placing my bet on any pension funds being present 30 years from now.


All of this is not to be too alarmist. After all, simply existing in today's world means taking some level of risk. If I'm unlucky, I could be hit by a car tomorrow and end up paralyzed.

## Conclusion, or as close as I can get to one

The world is a deeply unfair place, and it may feel right to overly compensate to "make up" for certain things.
And I genuinely believe that a short life spent in a fulfilling fashion must be better than a long one spent in regret and mediocracy.

However, when you're taking risks in life, in hedonistic fashion, it's often not doing something fun with the risk of immediate death;
It's doing something fun with the risk of making yourself miserable, or having to spend a lot of effort on not being miserable, for the rest of your life - however long that may be.

If you're a music lover like me: Wear ear plugs diligently. Avoid the front rows at loud concerts. Ear damage will sneak up on you and slowly get worse without you noticing.

If you're not a music lover, consider which other nice things you have in your life which, if you were to lose them, would make the rest of it miserable.
Think about the level of risk you're willing to take 

If you struggle with depression or anxiety - ...
