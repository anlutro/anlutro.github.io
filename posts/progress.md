I just felt like congratulating myself a bit.

When I started at my first job as a programmer two months ago, I'm not afraid to admit I was still a complete dumbass, although I knew how to get stuff done.

I got the job thanks to us having a lot of Wordpress clients, and Wordpress was the only platform where I had some actual experience I could point to. No classes, lots of global variables, raw SQL queries and tons of repeating code. Somewhere in my first project I had to change the code of an existing plugin to make it work properly with another plugin, and suddenly I'd learned how JOIN works.

On my third project I had started off by defining the main HTML in index.php when I finally understood how MVC was supposed to work - the controller fetches the relevant models and returns the view, the view doesn't fetch all the information it needs itself. I sat up late that evening and started fresh the next day.

I was now using the super-lightweight framework Slim, installed with Composer of course - and I decided to take it one step further and combine it with Laravel's DBAL/ORM Eloquent. During this time I also made the move from XAMPP to Vagrant - no more silly Windows file system irritations!

Now, pretty much everything I write is OOP, I have unit tests, I write makefiles to quickly get started with frameworks and libraries, I build my stuff on top of Twitter Bootstrap LESS and auto-concatenation+minifying along with livereload - pretty much nothing holding me back from simply writing code. I deploy my code with a simple `git push hub`.

On monday I'll be starting on a new larger project using Laravel.

I think I've come a long way in two months :)
