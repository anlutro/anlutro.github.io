> UPDATE: Note that I received a negative reply from Whatsapp, saying they think they do have legitimate reasons to collect said data.

WhatApp (part of Meta) recently announced some privacy changes for EEA, in order to comply with EU laws.
The long story short is that they're making it possible to opt out of a lot of data processing for privacy reasons, but are making it extremely difficult to do so.

1. Go to [this page](https://www.whatsapp.com/contact/forms/382532939919295/) (which I found buried deep in their [privacy policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy-eea#privacy-policy-how-to-exercise-your-rights) page)
2. Select "How can I make an objection to the processing of my information?"
3. You will receive an email with the subject "Data Subject Rights Form" asking which data you object to being used, and what your justification is. This email will be in your local language, but I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to reply to it in English.

Here is the email I sent in response to the request. I think it's generic enough that you can simply copy-paste and use for yourself.

> I object to:
>
> - The processing of my personal information for direct marketing purposes.
>
> I also object to my data being used for:
>
> - Business intelligence and analytics.
> - To preserve and share information with others including law enforcement and to respond to legal requests.
> - To preserve and share information when you seek legal advice or seek to protect yourself in the context of litigation and other disputes.
> - To promote safety, integrity and security outside of the performance of your contract with me.
> - To improve the WhatsApp customer support service.
> - To improve the WhatsApp Service by developing new features or updating existing features.
>
> Whatsapp collects this information as on the basis of my legitimate interest as per GDPR Art.6-1f.
> I object to this legitimate interest as per GDPR Art.21-1, as they violate my right to privacy as per the EU charter of fundamental rights.

The things I object to here are copy-pasted from the page above, to ensure I'm covering all the data processing they're doing.
