# Playing Brood War

**Step 1: Install StarCraft + Brood War**

Basically use any method you want to install the game - digital download from Blizzard, buy a CD copy, torrent it... The game is so old that you can play just fine without a valid serial. There are also some portable versions floating around, which are basically tiny versions of the game (anywhere between 20-100MB) where stuff like singleplayer, music etc. has been cut from the game.

**Step 2: Install iCCup Launcher**

The iCCup server is the place to play, and has been for some years now. By using the iCCup Launcher and playing on their server, you will not only be able to play on a functional ladder, but you'll also be able to minimize lag through some improved netcode.

Download the launcher [here](http://www.iccup.com/files/view/Anti-Hack_Launcherr.html) and install it wherever you like. Start it up, look through all the settings and start Brood War to get started to check that everything is working.

You'll also need to install the [iCCup map pack](http://www.iccup.com/files/view/iCCup_MapPack_02.html). Put them anywhere in StarCraft\\Maps\\Brood War - I recommend making an iCCup folder specifically for iCCup maps.

**Step 3: Joining the iCCup server**

Before logging into the server, you need to [create an account](http://www.iccup.com/register.html) on their website. Once you've done this, you can start Brood War, go into multiplayer, select the iCCup Server ("The Abyss") and log in.

Communication is done primarily through channels. By default you'll join a channel for players around your skill on the ladder where you can ask or look for ranked games. Type **/j [channel]** to join a different channel. If you want to talk to friends, the easiest way is to agree on a channel where you meet.

The server has a friends system which lets you know when people are online and when they join a game. To add a friend, type **/F A [nick]** - if online, he will be notified that you have added him so he can add you back. Type **/F L** to get a list of all your friends. **/F R [nick]** will remove friends.

If you want to privately message someone, simply type **/msg [nick] [message]**. If someone's just messaged you, you can type **/r [message]** to reply to them.

**Step 4: Playing**

Once you've found someone to play with, one of you need to host a game. If you don't know which map to pick, pick Fighting Spirit - it's probably the most standard and balanced maps around. If you want people to watch, make sure you pick an obs map. Also make sure you pick **Use Map Settings** - if you pick **Melee**, the game will count as a ranked ladder game.

When hosting a game you give the game a name and password. Make it something short and simple, then give the information to the people you want to join your game by messaging them. The normal way of doing this is just by typing **/msg [nick] name//pass**.

To join a game, simply click the big Join button on the left side of the screen and type in the game's name and password. Good luck and have fun!
