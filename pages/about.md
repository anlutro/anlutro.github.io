Programming has been my main hobby since I got my hands on a book on C when I
was 12 years old. I consider myself a quick learner with a structured workflow.
Having contributed to many of the platforms and tools that I use, I'm a big fan
of open-source.

Other than computers and programming, I enjoy [movies](/movies)/TV shows,
[music](/music), travel, playing the guitar, and the occasional video game.
