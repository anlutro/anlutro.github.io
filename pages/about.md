Programming has been my main hobby since I got my hands on a book on C when I
was 12 years old. I consider myself a quick learner with a structured workflow.
Big fan of open-source, have contributed to many of the platforms and tools I've
used.

Other than computers and programming, I enjoy movies/TV shows, music, travel,
playing the guitar, and the occasional video game.
