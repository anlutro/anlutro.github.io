# Andreas Lutro

Born and raised in Norway, currently living in Amsterdam. Programming has been my main hobby since I got my hands on a book on C when I was 12 years old, and managed to turned it into a profession in 2013. Passionate about best practices, automation, and maintainability. Always trying to be an open, honest, and reliable person, constantly trying to improve and learn new things.

My technical skills include programming, code design, database management, Linux administration, automation, configuration management, orchestration tools, high availability, scalability, and lots more. More than that, though, I enjoy using and developing technology to help people, either by making their workload smaller or easier, or enabling them to do new things. I enjoy talking to these people, figure out their (or their business') needs and how to meet them.
